The statistics services (own and third-party) used by the Website may use cookies for the purposes of establishing metrics and usage patterns of the Website.\n\nThe use of cookies lets the server on which the Website is hosted recognise your web browser and know your connection IP address, source (URL), use time, browsing history and preferences so as to make your browsing more straightforward and allow, for example, access if you have previously registered, and access to areas, services,promotions or competitions reserved exclusively for you without you having to log in on each visit. Cookies are also used to measure the audience and traffic parameters and to track the trend and number of visits.\n\n\n**What are Cookies?**\n\nA cookie is a file downloaded to your computer when you access certain Web pages. Cookies allow a Web page to, among other things, store and retrieve data on the browsing habits of a user or their device. Depending on the information in the cookies and how you use your computer, cookies may be used to recognise you.\n\n**Why are Cookies Important?**\n\nCookies are useful for several reasons. From a technical point of view, they allow web pages to work more efficiently and adapted to the User’s preferences, such as storing their language or the currency of their country. In addition, they help those responsible for the websites to improve the services they offer, thanks to the statistical information they collect through them all. Finally, they help to make the advertising we display more efficient.\n\n**Types of Cookies**\n\n_By entity managing the domain_\n\n- First-party cookies\n\n- Third-party cookies\n\n_By expiry_\n\n- Session cookies\n\n- Persistent cookies\n\n_By purpose_\n\n- Technical cookies\n\n- Personalisation cookies\n\n_Analysis cookies_\n\n- Behavioural advertising cookies\n\n\n\n**What Type of Cookies Do We Use?**\n\nAnalysis Cookies: Are those cookies that, treated by us or by third parties, allow us to quantify the number of users and thus perform the measurement and statistical analysis of the use made by users of the service offered. To do this, we analyze your browsing on our website in order to improve the offer of products or services we offer you.\n\nTechnical Cookies: These are essential and strictly necessary for the correct functioning of a web portal and the use of the different options and services it offers.\n\nBehavioural Advertising Cookies: Cookies which store information on user behaviour obtained through continuous observation of their browsing habits, which allows to develop a specific profile and display advertisement appropriate to this profile.\n\n\n**Cookies by entity managing them:**\n\n_Google Analytics_\n\no Cookie name: _ga\n\no Entity: Google Analytics (https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US)\n\no Type of cookie: Analysis cookie\n\no Description: cookie used to identify unique users\n\no Retention period: two years\n\no Cookie name: _gid\n\no Entity: Google Analytics (https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en-US)\n\no Type of cookie: Analysis cookie\n\no Description: cookie used to identify users\n\no Retention period: 24 hours\n\n\n\n**Who Are the Recipients of the Information? Where Are They Located?**\n\nThe information collected through Cookies may be used both by UBDC and by third-party collaborating companies, such as advertising network operators and agents and/or advertises, for the purposes described in the previous section.\n\n\nSome of these third-parties may be located in third countries whose legislation does not offer an equivalent level of data protection; however, the User may consult the appropriate guarantees they offer to ensure that international transfers of data are carried out taking into account the rights and freedoms of the data subjects.\n\n\nThe User can find out more about these third-parties, as well as the types of cookies they install, the purposes for which they process the data, the guarantees they offer to carry out international transfers, the retention periods, and how preferences can be configured with respect to them, through their privacy policies. In any case, UBDC is not liable for the accuracy and content of the privacy policies offered by such third parties on their websites.\n\n\n\n**Cookies Management**\n\nTaking into account the information provided in this Cookies Policy, below we explain how you can manage the cookies used on the Web via the different options of the most common browsers (Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, Safari and Opera). The \"Help\" functionality of most browsers tells you how to configure your browser to not accept cookies, to notify you whenever you receive a new cookie and to completely disable all cookies.\n\n\nYou can also disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as \"Flash Cookies\", by changing the settings of these add-ons. For more information, visit the websites of the add-on manufacturers.\n\n\n\nFor instance, you can find out how to manage your cookie preferences in the most common browsers via the following links:\n\n- Firefox\n- Chrome\n- Explorer\n- Safari\n- Opera\n- If you use a different browser, see the documentation for your browser.\n\n\nThe opt-out mechanism creates a cookie that allows us to remember that you don't want additional cookies. However, if you delete your cookies after opting out, you will have to opt out again.\n\n\nThese changes only apply to the browser you are currently using. To delete cookies in other browsers, you must follow the process described in those browsers.","data":{"title":"Cookies Policy","author":"andrew.c.clarke@glasgow.ac.uk","category":"legal","tags":["google analytics","gdpr","cookies"]},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":"","id":"/docs/cookies-policy"},{"content":"\n#### Table of Contents\n\n\n# Explainer \n-------------------------\nThis document shows the admonitions you can use to draw attention to information.\n\nAdmonitions are created using the following markdown syntax:\n\n```markdown\n> [!warning]\n> This is a warning admonition\n```\n\n# Possible Admonition Types\n-------------------------\n1. note\n2. tip\n3. warning\n4. abstract\n5. info\n6. todo\n7. success\n8. question\n9. failure\n10. danger\n11. bug\n12. example\n13. quote \n\n\nAdmonitions are managed by [@portaljs/remark-callouts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@portaljs/remark-callouts).

Clone the repository - `git clone https://github.com/urbanbigdatacentre/ubdc-web-starter-kit.git`\n> 2. Add folders and new `.md` files to the `/docs` directory\n> 3. Start the Next.js server and explore your docs site - `npm run dev`\n> 4. Deploy with Docker - config included\n\n# Creating a new page\n-------------------------\nDocs are stored as markdown files in the `/docs` directory. They get automatically added to the site and a new route is created for each page.\n\nTo create a new page, simply create a new markdown file in the `/docs` directory. You can add meta information to the top of the page including a `title`\n`author` and `category`.\n\n# Using Images\n-------------------------\nImages are bundled through [Next.js Static Assets](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/static-assets) and can be added to your markdown files by adding the following code:\n\n```markdown\n![alt text](/path/to/image.png \"Image Title\")\n```\nYou can store images in the `/public` directory and reference them directly in your markdown files.\n\nFor instance, if you have an image called `my-image.png` in the `/public/images` directory, you can add it to your markdown file like so:\n\n```markdown\n![alt text](/images/my-image.png \"Image Title\")\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n","data":{"title":"Overview","author":"andrew.c.clarke@glasgow.ac.uk","category":"getting-started","tags":["how to use","markdown","next.js","docker","static site","documentation"]},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":"","id":"/docs/getting-started/overview"},{"content":"\n#### Table of Contents\n\n## Explainer\n-------------------------\nThis is a quick start guide to help you get up and running with your documentation site. The app is designed to be able quick and easy for anyone to use. \n\nYou can add new folders, pages and markdown content and the site will automatically add new routes and render your new content. \n\n#### Pre-requisites\n-------------------------\nWe assume you have the following installed on your machine:\n- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)\n- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) or [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#mac-stable)\n- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)\n\nFor Deployment\n- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)\n\nIf you haven't already done so, clone the repository:\n\n```bash\ngit clone -b docs https://github.com/urbanbigdatacentre/ubdc-web-starter-kit.git\n```\n\n> **In this guide**\n> 1. Configure your site\n> 2. Add content\n> 3. Start the server\n> 4. Explore your docs\n\n## 1. Configure your site\nYou should already have cloned the repository and have a local folder with the project files. To install the dependencies, run the following command in the root of the project:\n\n```bash\nnpm install\n```\n\nThis will install all the dependencies required to run the app.\n\nNow find the `appConfig.ts` file in the `/config` directory. This file contains all the configuration options for your site. You can change the following global variables here:\n\n```javascript\n\nexport const siteTitle = 'UBDC Web Starter Kit';\nexport const siteDescription = 'A starter kit for creating web apps with Next.js, Material UI, and TypeScript.';\nexport const siteKeywords = 'docs, starter, template';\nexport const siteAuthor = 'Your Name';\nexport const pathToLogo = '/ubdc-logo.png';\nexport const pathToFavicon = '/favicon.ico';\nexport const redirectPath = '/docs/getting-started/overview'\nexport const siteTag = 'v0.0.1';\n```\n\nYou can also change the `logo` and `favicon` by adding your own images to the `/public/images` directory and referencing them in the config file.\n\n## 2. Add content\nDocs are stored as markdown files in the `/docs` directory. Find the docs directory. You can add new folders and new `.md` files to the `/docs` directory. They will automatically appear on your docs site.\n1. Add a new markdown file to the `/docs` directory called 'example.md'\n2. Add the following content to the top of the file:\n\n```markdown\n---\ntitle: Example\nauthor: <your-email>\ncategory: getting-started\n---\n```\nThis content is used to generate the page title, author and category.\n\nAdd the following markdown content to the file:\n\n```markdown\n# Example Page\nThis is an example page. You can add any markdown content here.\n\n## Subheading\nYou can add subheadings and more markdown content.\n\n### Sub-subheading\nYou can add sub-subheadings and more markdown content.\n\n#### Sub-sub-subheading\nYou get the picture.\n```\n\n## 3. Start the server\nYour docs site is now ready to roll. To start the server, run the following command in the root of the project:\n\n```bash\nnpm run dev\n```\n\nThis will start the Next.js server and open your docs site in your default browser. You can now explore your docs site at `http://localhost:3000`.\n\n## 4. Explore your docs\nYou can now explore your docs site. You can add new folders and new `.md` files to the `/docs` directory. To get them to appear - refresh the page.","data":{"title":"Quick Start","author":"andrew.c.clarke@glasgow.ac.uk","category":"getting-started","tags":["how to use","markdown","next.js","docker","static site","documentation"]},"isEmpty":false,"excerpt":"","id":"/docs/getting-started/quick-start"}]
