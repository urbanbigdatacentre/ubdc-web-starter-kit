# ðŸ‘‹ Overview
This is a dummy documentation page to illustrate the creation of dynamic html pages from markdown files.
Dynamic documentation pages are stored as markdown files in the `/docs` directory.

# ðŸ“„ Creating a new page
To create a new page, simply create a new markdown file in the `/docs` directory. You can add meta information to the top of the page including a `title`
'slug' and `description`. The slug is used to generate the url for the page. The title is used in the navigation menu and the description is used in the meta tags.
